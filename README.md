# Web Application Vulnerability Assessment and Penetration Testing (VAPT)
📜 Abstract

Vulnerability assessment is the process of scanning software, such as operating systems, application software, and IT systems (e.g., computers and networks), to find known and unknown vulnerabilities. Up to 80% of websites have security weaknesses that can expose critical company information, such as credit card numbers and customer data, to potential theft.

Hackers often target web-based applications like shopping carts, forms, login pages, and dynamic content. These applications, accessible around the clock from anywhere in the world, can provide direct access to backend corporate databases if not properly secured.

As part of my learning experience, I conducted a VAPT on:

   1) A demo website known for its vulnerabilities, to identify and understand high-severity issues.
   2) A live website to simulate a real-world scenario and discover vulnerabilities, showcasing how a VAPT can be effectively carried out.

🔍 Project Overview

   - Objective:
      To understand and identify common vulnerabilities in web applications and demonstrate how to perform a Vulnerability Assessment and Penetration Testing (VAPT) process.
   
   - Methodology:
       - Conducted vulnerability scans on a demo website with known vulnerabilities.
       - Performed a real-world VAPT on a live website, following ethical guidelines.

 📊 Findings:
      - Identified high-severity vulnerabilities in web applications.
      - Gained insights into real-world security threats through testing on a live website.
      - Emphasized the importance of regular vulnerability assessments to safeguard sensitive data.
